Script (derived from https://github.com/osrf/multiarch-docker-image-generation and https://github.com/cmsj/nintendo-switch-ubuntu-builder) to generate SteamOS 64bit ARM images for Nintendo Switch.

It produces `clockwerk.tgz` which I unpack onto a freshly formatted SD card (second partition of course. First partition needs to be a small, formatted FAT32). I'm booting it on the Switch using fail0verflow's exploit chain and kernel (see https://fail0verflow.com/blog/2018/shofel2/)

TODO:
 * ~~3D acceleration (rebuild Mesa packages from git, possibly leveraging any packaging differences in https://launchpad.net/~oibaf/+archive/ubuntu/graphics-drivers/+packages)~~
  * Once this is working, there's some kind of `DRI_PRIME` offloading that can be done, see https://github.com/fail0verflow/shofel2/blob/master/configs/xinitrc-header.sh
 * ~~Getting Xorg to rotate the screen *and* have the touchscreen input on the right axes, has been challenging (there are so many damn X startup files)~~
 * WiFi only works on a second boot (this seems to be affecting everyone doing Switch linux)
 * Bluetooth almost works, but the MAC address is AA-AA-AA-etc and pairing doesn't happen
 * Investigate getting the f0f patches onto an Ubuntu kernel, since they do package upstream releases. Need to find a suitable 4.16 package.
 * ~~Investigate if we can store the kernel and dtb inside the rootfs image and change the switch.scr u-boot script to use ext4load, to load them both, rather than have them live on the exploit host~~
 * locales are not configured, which causes issues with various things (sudo dpkg-reconfigure -plow locales is helpful, but we ought to be able to automate this)
 * ~~GDM isn't rotated properly if it's ever needed (e.g. restarting the session from gnome-control-center doesn't automatically log back in)~~
 * Get audio working (datasheet for codec chip is https://wenku.baidu.com/view/25f933653a3567ec102de2bd960590c69ec3d8bc.html)
 * Get USB working
 * Graphical boot screen instead of text console
 * ~~Provide an all-in-one SD card image that self-expands on first boot (like Raspberry Pi does)~~

What does work:
 * It boots into X and the Ubuntu desktop session with 3D acceleration
 * touchscreen works
 * volume buttons (the events are seen, there's just no audio device to control yet)
 * backlight (which I want to disable, because it changes the backlight very aggressively and it's super annoying)
 * once you're on wifi (i.e. you've done a soft reboot and run the f0f boot chain again) you can enable https://help.gnome.org/users/gnome-help/stable/sharing-desktop.html.en which is very helpful! (also you can ssh to switch@switch.local with the password `switch`)
